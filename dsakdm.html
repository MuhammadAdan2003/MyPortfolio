  <li>
    To promote financing for small and marginalized farmers, particularly in
    unserved and underserved areas, the Government of Pakistan, on the
    recommendation of the SBP, has approved a Risk Coverage Scheme for Small
    Farmers and Underserved Areas.
  </li>
  <li>
    All production loans for crops and loans for dairy &amp; livestock and
    fisheries provided during 01-Jul-25 to 30-Jun-28 are eligible under the
    scheme.
  </li>
  <li>
    All Commercial Banks, Islamic Banks, Specialized Banks, and Microfinance
    Banks (MFBs) are eligible to participate.
  </li>
  <li>
    Eligible farmers include subsistence and small farmers in Punjab and Sindh,
    and farmers of all landholding sizes in KP, Balochistan, AJK, and GB.
  </li>
  <li>
    The maximum loan size under the scheme is Rs3.0 million for the tenor of up
    to 12 months, extendable to 18 months for sugarcane.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Government provides 10% first-loss risk coverage on the principal amount
    of loans extended to new borrowers and on the incremental outstanding
    portfolio of existing borrowers. To incentivize outreach, GoP will pay
    Rs10,000 per new borrower to banks, subject to a net annual increase in
    borrowers.
